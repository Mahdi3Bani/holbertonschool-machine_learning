During PLD, you will collaboratively review prior projects with a group of cohort peers.\nPLD Basics\nPLDs are mandatory on-site days from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. If you cannot be present or on time, you must use a PTO. \nNo laptops, tablets, or screens are allowed until all tasks have been whiteboarded and understood by the entirety of your group. This time is for whiteboarding, dialogue, and active peer collaboration. After this, you may return to computers with each other to pair or group program. \nPeer Learning Days are not about sharing solutions. This doesn't empower peers with the ability to solve problems themselves! Peer learning is when you share your thought process, whether through conversation, whiteboarding, debugging, or live coding. \nWhen a peer has a question, rather than offering the solution, ask the following:\n\"How did you come to that conclusion?\"\n\"What have you tried?\"\n\"Did the man page give you a lead?\"\n\"Did you think about this concept?\"\nModeling this form of thinking for one another is invaluable and will strengthen your entire cohort.\nYour ability to articulate your knowledge is a crucial skill and will be required to succeed during technical interviews and through your career. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(semantic_search('/kaggle/input/mockinterview', 'What is a Mock Interview'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-17T22:03:49.840276Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-17T22:03:49.840886Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-17T22:03:51.519141Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-17T22:03:49.840842Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-17T22:03:51.517629Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/huggingface_hub/file_download.py:1132: FutureWarning: `resume_download` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0.
